//*                window, for example:  the compare may go only    *   FILE1003
//*                from columns 10 thru 30, if you code '10,21'     *   FILE1003
//*                as a PARM.  This program can be of great help    *   FILE1003
//*                in synchronizing two files.                      *   FILE1003

//*     PDSCLR   - Program to clear a PDS of all its members.       *   FILE1003
//*                The technique used in this program is to         *   FILE1003

//*     CLOPS    - A small program to change DSCBs. The program     *   FILE1003
//*                opens a data set for output with DIS=MOD and     *   FILE1003
//*                closes it again. This causes the dscb to be      *   FILE1003
//*                written back including modifications specified   *   FILE1003

//*                The rules which strings are legal are those      *   FILE1003
